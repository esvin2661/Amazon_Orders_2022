Data analysis project that involves reading in a CSV file containing data on Amazon orders, cleaning and preprocessing the data using the pandas library, and creating a bar chart to visualize the total spending on these orders over a specified period of time. The x-axis of the chart displays the order dates and the y-axis displays the total value of the orders. The chart is created using the plotly.express library and is interactive, meaning that it can be panned and zoomed using the mouse. This project can help users understand and analyze their spending on Amazon orders and identify any trends or patterns in their spending over time.
